# OptionNFT
Wrap ERC-721 in another ERC-721 call-option


## Crypto asset management using Option NFT sub contracts


We propose a new type of derevative NFT called Option NFT which "wraps" an underlying NFT to a special smart ontract.
It is quite different from an Option cntract used on market due to the key Non-fungible feature of NFT, and it's low liquidity. 
Although, it preserves the main idea, and can be compared to a land option contract for example.


By making an Option NFT, you you are adding an exclusive right to buy feature to the original NFT. 
Now, The contract itself owns NFT, offering it's owner (and only it's owner) an *option* to buy underlying NFT.
This makes possible to create custom, privte deals for NFT at a fixed price, which gives more controll over the risks to a potential buyer.



Option stock contracts are know to be used to redue risk of an unwanted strike price change for an underlying security.
